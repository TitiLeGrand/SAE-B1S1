# Disclaimer
At the time of writing the code, we were not yet familiar with many basics (we had not yet mastered arrays, subroutines, pointers, ...). That's why, upon revisiting the code, I can now realize that I have evolved a lot and that I would have done everything differently. I would have also added comments.

# Subject
For this project, we were in groups of three, and we had to create simple games in C++ to present them during open days, thus allowing prospective students to see what we were capable of creating after a few months in the Computer Science Bachelor's program at Nevers.

# Result
For this project, we developed several games:

- Rock Paper Scissors
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Price Guessing
- 50 points
- Yam's
- Pokemon Battle
In hindsight, we should have created separate files for each game, but at the time of writing the code, we didn't know that was possible.
