# Subject
In this SAE, we had to create a SQL database for a fictional travel agency in groups of three. Obviously, it involves designing a database with more or less complex queries and a certain amount of data.

# What This Project Taught Me
This project allowed me to better understand SQL and all the logic behind it. It strengthened my skills in understanding client needs (as the initial instructions were far from clear) as well as teamwork.
