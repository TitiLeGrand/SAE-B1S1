# Subject
For this SAE, we had to create a showcase website in a group of three on a topic chosen by us and validated by a teacher. We opted to create a wiki on the game Valorant, a tactical and competitive first-person shooter.

We chose this topic because we noticed the absence of a website simply gathering various information about the game. Thus, we developed pages on the different playable characters and maps, as well as on the various ranks and available weapons. Additionally, we also created pages to explain the entire history of the game's universe and characters.

# Implementation Conditions
For this project, we formed a group of three people. One of us was responsible for creating the template and writing the JavaScript script to change the colors of titles with a certain class. He also designed the homepage (main), the Wiki page, the agents' pages, as well as the quiz in its entirety. Another member was in charge of the pages on weapons and ranks. As for my contribution, I took charge of creating the pages for the maps, as well as all the universe and character pages.

# What This Project Taught Me
This project obviously gave me a better command of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages. But it also improved the efficiency of my internet research for obtaining real-time information and for code-related documentation. Moreover, it strengthened my teamwork skills as well as my ability to listen and work independently.
